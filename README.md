# Simple Java ORM

A very compact ORM specifically built for Java

---

## What is it?

SJORM is, like stated before, a very compact Object Relationship Mapper (ORM). It allows developers to integrate this library within their project to easily communicate with their desired database.

## What is an ORM?
Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.
